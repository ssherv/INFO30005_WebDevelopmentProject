# INFO30005_WebDevelopmentProject
A web app that helps people to manage their diabetes in the convenience of their own home, recording data that can be monitored remotely by their clinician. Includes 2 different user-interfaces: one for clinicians (desktop only) and another for patients (desktop, tablet, mobile). 

This web-application implements responsive design to a moderate degree. The web-app should only be viewed at the following resolutions: 
<ul>
  <li> PHONE: 375 x 812 (portrait)</li>
  <li> TABLET: 1024 x 768 (iPad, landscape)</li>
  <li> Desktop: 1920 Ã— 1080 (monitor, landscape)</li>
</ul>

<h4> Completed in June 2022 (Semester 2) with a group of 5 participants</h4>
